Function smallestEvenMultiple(n):
    If n is odd:
        Return n * 2
    Else:
        Return n


Explanation:
Function smallestEvenMultiple(n):

The function takes a number n as a parameter.
The goal of the function is to find the smallest even multiple of n.
Condition If n is odd:

If n is odd (which means the remainder of dividing n by 2 is not zero, i.e., n % 2 != 0), then:
The function returns n * 2 because the smallest even multiple of an odd number is always the number itself multiplied by 2. For example, the smallest even multiple of 5 is 5 * 2 = 10.
Else (if n is even):

If n is not odd, meaning it is even (the remainder of dividing n by 2 is zero, i.e., n % 2 == 0), then:
The function simply returns n because the number itself is already the smallest even multiple. For example, the smallest even multiple of 6 is 6.
Summary of the Pseudocode:
If n is odd: Multiply n by 2 and return that value.
If n is even: Return n itself.
This pseudocode describes the logic in a simple manner, focusing on the decision-making process based on whether n is odd or even, without specific details of programming syntax.
