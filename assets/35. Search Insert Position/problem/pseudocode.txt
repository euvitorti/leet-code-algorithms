Explanation of the Pseudocode:
Function Definition: Defines a function searchInsert that takes an array of integers nums and an integer target.
Initialization: Initializes two pointers, low and high, to define the search range.
While Loop: Continues until the low pointer exceeds the high pointer.
Middle Calculation: Calculates the middle index mid.
Check for Target: If the value at mid equals the target, sets low to mid and breaks the loop.
Adjust Pointers: Adjusts high or low based on the comparison between target and nums[mid].
Return Statement: Returns the index where the target was found or where it should be inserted.
