# LeetCode Challenges

Welcome to my LeetCode challenges repository! Here, you will find solutions to various problems I have solved on the platform, using **Java** and **JavaScript**.

## About

**LeetCode** is an amazing platform for practicing programming logic and algorithms. In this repository, I share the solutions I have developed, with comments and explanations to help understand the solutions.

When copying the code, I advise against doing so directly. Instead, use my solutions as inspiration for how to approach the problems. Note that in LeetCode, the class name is typically `Solution`, while in my local files, the class name is based on the specific problem. You will need to adapt the code to make it work on LeetCode.

You can access the LeetCode site here: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).
